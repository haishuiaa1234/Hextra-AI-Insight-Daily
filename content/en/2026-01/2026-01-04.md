### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1. **Baidu Kunlunxin targets Hong Kong IPO.**
Baidu's Kunlunxin is making a bold move, gunning for a [Hong Kong IPO (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/01/366454.html). This chip division is already valued at a whopping ¥21 billion RMB, with giants like BYD jumping in as investors. They're currently China's second-largest domestic AI chip supplier by shipments. The goal? To raise independent capital and go head-to-head with Nvidia. 💪

2. **Yann LeCun slams Zuckerberg after resignation.**
Yann LeCun, after exiting Meta, is absolutely *scorching* 🔥. He's openly criticized Zuck for allegedly rigging benchmark tests, flat-out stating that large language models have hit a ceiling. Word on the street is, internal researchers at Meta weren't exactly thrilled with him, believing Meta wasn't his ideal home. 😬 [View Interview Details (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6958b5620d0cd914a814f5c5)<br/><br/>![AI News: Yann LeCun Interview Screen](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01ke25xqnjf549sj90asfwjfe0.avif)<br/>

3. **2025 LLM development annual review.**
The year 2025 saw AI get both smarter and pricier. 💸 Inference models and Agents became industry standards, with the CLI (command-line interface) re-emerging as the main battleground for development. Chinese models actually broke the US tech monopoly, which is pretty wild! However, developers often chased efficiency, accidentally (or intentionally) ignoring safety red lines. 🤫 [Read Annual Review (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2007110456562057724)

4. **IQuest-Coder code model embroiled in cheating controversy.**
IQuest-Coder, a 40B-parameter [open-source code model (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46472667), *claimed* to outperform Claude and GPT-5. But guess what? The community smelled something fishy 🚨. They found that its repository contained uncleared .git files, leading to suspicions that its training data might have *included* test set answers. This kind of "benchmaxxing" has sparked widespread doubts, and SWE-bench has already rolled out an urgent fix. 😅
